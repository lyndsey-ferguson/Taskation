	√ add the activity to the document window

== October 17th, 2008: 10:03 AM ==

DONE:
	√ enable the enableStartStopRecordingButton boolean as there is text in the action/subject combo box.
	√ properly populate the combo boxes with the appropriate subject/action strings (or IDs with a value transformer).
	√ create an activity from the data in the combo boxes

SCM CHANGES:
	- Renamed TSKComboBoxDataDepot to TSKActivityComboBoxDepot
	- Removed TSKUniqueStringTransformer

Pulled out the Activity Controls View Controller class and made it the instance variable for the document window.

Got the doc tool bar to draw the view and the default view that I chose.

Began work on monitoring the comboboxes and sending a message to the delegate.

TODO:
	- enable the enableStartStopRecordingButton boolean as there is text in the action/subject combo box.
	- properly populate the combo boxes with the appropriate subject/action strings (or IDs with a value transformer).
	- create an activity from the data in the combo boxes
	- add the activity to the document window
	- update the activity as time passes
	- display dates and elapsed time in human readible format
	- add support for textual notes to be added
	- add support for voice notes to be added
	- add support for image notes to be added
	- add support for video notes to be added (optional)
	- add support to save and load journal files
	- add support to filter the tasks displayed by action, subject, start time, elapsed time and/or finished time.
	- add support to create a pie chart of the displayed tasks.

Updated the ComboBox Data Depot Class to use the Action Strings and Subject Strings that are found in the Shared User Defaults. These
	defaults should be able to be changed by the user. When changed, the combobox should be able to take advantage of that. Actually, currently
	they may not be able to and we'll have to change how we retrieve the data as the dictionary may not change when the user changes the defaults.
	
Worked on making the Start/Stop Recording button enable properly. I think I have to pass the ComboBoxHasEntry function where the notification
	came from as the selection index and combobox field contents do not seem to remain synchronized.
	
TODO:
	- Update the ComboBox Data Depot Class to access the User Dictionary using a key rather than having its own pointer to a dict.
	- Update the Check Enable State of the Record button so that we are looking at the selection index or field contents when appropriate.

Created the Action and Subject default value dictionaries.

Created the App Delegate classes initialize function that creates the default dictionary and action and subject transformers.

Began to update the combobox data depot classes.

I have the Activity Table View hooked up to a NSArrayController and reduced the amount of code required by Taskation.

I am looking into hooking up the ComboBoxes to NSArrayControllers so that they will work with a NSArray of Numerical Identifiers
	(Unique Action or Subject values) and use a Value-Transformer to ensure that the correct NSString is returned. It is not
	working yet as there seems to be problems with the key-value coding (or something).
	
I need to read up more on the Cocoa Bindings Documentation.

== September 28th, 2008: 10:48 PM ==

I have rewritten the application so that there is less coupling and it is better factored out.

The application is now named Taskation. There are many things which I am not familiar with and think I should be using, but my understanding
of Cocoa is too limited; I am uncertain of what to do. Cocoa Bindings sound promising. Key-Value Coding sounds promising. But I am
unsure of where to go with this.

I think I will read the manuals fon Key-Value Objserving.

Here are the known outstanding issues:
	- when I hit the record button, the window resizes, perhaps too much. Also, the details view seems to be moved too far down.
	

== September 21st, 2008: 1:53 PM ==

I have accomplished a fair bit of work:
	- adding a new activity via the console actually adds it to the current document as
		well as starting the timer.
		
Here are some outstanding issues:
 - The console window is vertically-resiable when there is no active activity. It should only be horizontally-resiable
 - The console window resizes upward when the user clicks the record button. It should resize downward.
 - The elapssed time displays as a double not as seconds, minutes, hours and days.
 - The start and end time are not displayed in the corrent manner.
 - The document window doesn't show the criteria view
 - The document window doesn't show the notes view.

I have added the basic menu items for the Windows Journal Document Window.

I have hooked up the Windows shell to call into the kernel.

I have started working on fleshing out the journal document gui.

I have created the kernel and shell document controller classes.

I am trying to get the table view to display a pre-canned set of data. For some reason it is only displaying the action and subject in each
column even though I have different strings for the different cells. I have to look into this.

I have found a better direction to take other than named pipes. Much better: I can basically
incorporate my C++ classes directly into my C# and Objective-C applications using managed C++
classes and Objective-C++.

After receiving this knowledge, I proceeded to:

	1. Remove all the LDFUtilities code as I won't be needing the majority of it now.
	2. Remove the concept of kernel/shell applications from both the Xcode and Visual Studio Projects.
	3. Update both projects to simply interface to the AJKernelAppController C++ class for now.

	** TODO **
	1. Finish adding the appropriate menu items for both platforms.
	2. Hook up the basic menu items to call into the C++ app controller class.
	3. Update the GUI designs.
	4. Create the AJKernelDocument C++ class.
	5. Finish the GUI for the Journal Document for both platforms.
	6. Hook up the GUI to the C++ code.
	7. And much more.

I've found some code on the internet that will allow me to interface to named pipes within
C# (.NET 2.0). Apparently, while .NET 3.5 has named pipes, I prefer to keep the earlier version
as my development environment to be more compatible with what users may have.

I have begun my LDFNamedPipe C# class, but it needs work.

	** TODO **
	1. Augment the LDFNamedPipe class.
	2. Create the input pipe in the Windows shell.
	3. Augment the AJShellDispatcher C# class to be able to respond to messages from the
		kernel.
	4. Hook up the AJKernelAppController class.

== June 22nd, 2008: 6:43 PM: ==

I've accomplished a lot since the last entry:

1. Stepped back and created the Use Cases for the application.
2. Created the Use Case Scenario Flow Diagrams.
3. Created the UML Class Objects
4. Finished all the User Interfaces
5. Reworked how I am going to build the C++ core engine and the Objective-C and C# shell interfaces.
	- Instead of building objective-c++ code and wrapping C# classes around C++ classes, I will build a cross-platform C++ "kernel" application and then the shell applications in the Operating System's native language.
6. Wrote the basic skeleton shell/kernel application combination for the Macintosh.
7. Began working out the basic skeleton shell/kernel application combination for Windows.

	** TODO **
	
	1. Create an input pipe in the Windows shell 
	2. Figure out why the Windows kernel is quitting early before the connections have been made
	3. Continue setting up the Windows shell/kernel application combination.

Created new folder TimeJournal

Removed all code from .../projects/TimeMinder/source/common/...
Put this code in .../projects/LDFUtilities/source/...

- Began work on the action data source, for some reason my combo box is not being populated. But I created a "C" interface to the "C++" Singleton, the ActionManager.
	- This entailed creating some cross-platform types and function prototypes.

- Got the console's views for new and current tasks to display and hide correctly. Refactored into tidy functions.
- Got the console's views for new and current tasks to resize correctly, even when hidden.

== January 22nd, 2008: 2:16 PM: == 

- Got the console window to display and hide correctly. The NSWindowController's window outlet was not hooked up to the window
	and I was not using the correct calls to show and hide (orderFront and orderOut)
- Set the Console window to not display in the main window list.

== January 21st, 2008: 8:09 PM: == 

- Created the Console.xib file
- Created the LDFAppController class
	- one method: toggleConsoleVisibility. This is not working for some reason, my Console window is not being displayed.
- Created the LDFConsoleController class
	- I am not sure if I am using the correct calls to get and set the window's visibility.
